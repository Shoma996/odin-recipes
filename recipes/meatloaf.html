<h4>How to make Meatloaf:</h4>
<p>It takes a little extra prep time to make the "sofritto" base of minced carrots, onions, celery, and garlic, but it is so so worth it! Like a giant Italian meatball, in loaf form. Meatball meatloaf.</p>
<p>It may look like the sofritto is a time consuming extra step for meatloaf, but you can easily put the vegetables in a food processor or mini chopper to speed up the prep time. The smaller mince size that you can get with the food processor will also help the meatloaf hold together better.</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</strong> Position a rack in the middle of the oven.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the vegetables, season, and add Worcestershire and half the ketchup:</strong> Melt the butter in a large, thick-bottomed skillet, on medium heat. When the butter starts to foam, add the finely chopped onions, celery, carrot, green onions and garlic to the pan and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.Cover the pan and cook for another 5 minutes, until the carrots are tender, stirring every so often.Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add the Worcestershire sauce and 1/3 cup ketchup. Cook for another minute and remove from heat to cool.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the meatloaf mixture:</strong> Once the vegetables have cooled to the touch, place them in a large bowl with the ground beef, Italian sausage, eggs, breadcrumbs and parsley. Use your (very clean) hands to mix them together until everything is evenly distributed.</li>
    <li><strong>Place in the loaf pan, cover with remaining ketchup:</strong> Place the meatloaf mixture into a loaf pan (either 4-x 8-inch or 5- x 9-inch) and press to make compact in the pan. Or you can form a free-standing loaf onto a rimmed baking pan. Cover the meatloaf mixture with the rest of the ketchup.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 1 hour at 350°F, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the meatloaf reads 155°F.Remove from oven and let sit for 10 minutes. Then use a metal spatula to gently lift the meatloaf out of the loaf pan to a serving plate.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Cut into thick slices to serve. The meatloaf makes great leftovers, just chill and reheat. Slices are good in sandwiches as well.</li>
